# Raytris
A simple legally distinct block stacking puzzle game using raylib and kallistios that runs on the sega dreamcast.

Anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code in this project.

## Purpose of this Repository
This is a block stacking puzzle game created using raylib following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM) by youtuber "[Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick)". I wanted to create a game for the sega dreamcast and get it running on actual hardware, but don't actually have any real experience with dreamcast homebrew development or C/C++ development, so this repository is going to show my whole learning process.

I have decided to continue past the tutorial in order to further develop my skills and make a nicer Raytris experience. You can see this [here](https://github.com/Niisoks/Tetris-RayLib4DC). If you are here _just_ to see what the tutorial looks like on kallistios, [please check the branch titled "TutorialCompletion"](https://github.com/Niisoks/Tetris-RayLib4DC/tree/TutorialCompletion).
