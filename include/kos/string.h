    \brief   Variants on standard block memory copy/set functions.
    \ingroup system_types
    \deprecated

    This file contains variants on the standard block memory copy/set functions.
    These variants copy/set memory in the specified block sizes, which may be
    helpful for interacting with memory-mapped hardware.

    \note
    None of these routines are actually faster than using the equivalent
    standard C functions such as memcpy() and memset()!

    \warning
    Due to the fact that it breaks C and C++'s strict aliasing rules, this
    entire API is no longer safe to use, as its calls can get optimized away
    and never happen with higher optimization levels!
