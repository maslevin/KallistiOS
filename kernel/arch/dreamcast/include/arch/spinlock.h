    \brief   Simple locking.
    \ingroup kthreads

    This file contains definitions for very simple locks. Most of the time, you
    will probably not use such low-level locking, but will opt for something
    more fully featured like mutexes, semaphores, reader-writer semaphores, or
    recursive locks.
